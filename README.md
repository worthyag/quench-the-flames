# quench-the-flames
A Tic Tac Toe ( or Noughts + Crosses) game with a twist.<br>

\*For the most part the game is complete, and is completely functional, however there are still some things that I would like to add, and some bugs left to completely iron out to improve the UX.  

You can view the game [here](https://worthyag.github.io/quench-the-flames/start.html).
